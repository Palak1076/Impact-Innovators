## 🎓 Project Overview

**Student Assistant** is an AI-driven educational platform developed as part of a **project-based competition**. It addresses the overwhelming academic load faced by college students by leveraging **Generative AI (Google Gemini)** to automatically summarize large volumes of study material (notes, audio, and video lectures) and instantly convert them into **active-recall flashcards**.

The platform promotes focused and efficient learning through structured study sessions, progress analytics, and collaborative study groups — all within a secure and scalable system.
